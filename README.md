# Trev's New Neovim Config

A 2024 migration over from [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Cultivated a lot of the plugins and features, stripped away the stuff I didn't
like or want. The entire LSP and completion stuff is entirely ripped from there
because it's still a huge pain to figure out and get right in a minimalistic
way.

Making a note to my future self that this will probably become a huge hassle to
maintain, which is why I used LazyVim in the first place. Hope not though!

## Features
- [x] lazy.nvim
- [x] Nord theme
- [x] Built-in LSP with completions and mason
- [x] Treesitter
- [x] Telescope
- [x] lualine.nvim statusline and bufferline
- [x] My favorite keybindings
- [x] Nice git integration
