# Trev's New Neovim Config

A 2024 migration over from [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Cultivated a lot of the plugins and features, stripped away the stuff I didn't
like or want. The entire LSP and completion stuff is entirely ripped from there
because it's still a huge pain to figure out and get right in a minimalistic
way.

Making a note to my future self that this will probably become a huge hassle to
maintain, which is why I used LazyVim in the first place. Hope not though!

## Features

- \[x\] lazy.nvim
- \[x\] Nord theme
- \[x\] LSP
- \[x\] Completions
- \[x\] Treesitter
- \[x\] Oil.nvim (dired clone)
- \[x\] fzf-lua
- \[x\] lualine.nvim statusline
- \[x\] My favorite keybindings
- \[x\] Git (gitsigns, diffview, neogit (magit clone))
